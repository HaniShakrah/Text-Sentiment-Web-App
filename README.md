# Text Sentiment Web App
 
The goal of this project was to gain experience with tools/concepts I have never used before, specifically Flask, HTML/CSS, Optuna, and TF-IDF feature extraction. 

# Included in this repository:

+ TextSentiment.ipynb - Code notebook containing end-to-end model building process
+ app.py - Flask app
+ templates/index.html - HTML for the web app
+ static/style.css - style for the web app
+ model.pkl - the trained model used for prediction stored as a pickle object
+ vectorizer.pkl - TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction stored as a pickle object
